# KMP-BM-String-Search-Algorithms
In this project we compare the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm as well as the Boyer-Moore algorithms and their runtimes
# How to Run the Code
- No dependencies
- Make sure you are in the correct directory
- Download all .txt files
- To choose which .txt file you would like to use, simply type in the file name where it says `std::ifstream file("1000.txt");`
- Compile by doing `g++ main.cpp -o main`
- `./main` to run the program
